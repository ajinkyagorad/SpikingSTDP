# Spiking Neural Network Simulation in MATLAB

## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating a spiking neural network using the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model. The neural network comprises both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The simulation includes features like spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), raster plots, weight histograms, and 3D visualizations of the network.

## Features

- Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model for neuron dynamics
- Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for synaptic weights
- Raster plots for visualizing spikes
- Weight histograms for synaptic weight distribution
- 3D visualization of the neural network
- External input current simulation

## Requirements

- MATLAB
- [Optional] MATLAB toolboxes for additional features

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SpikingNeuralNetworkMATLAB.git
```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository folder.
3. Run the main script:
```matlab
