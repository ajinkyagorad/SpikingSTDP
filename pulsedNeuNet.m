% pulsed neural like networks
% Motivation : Assume nature is not perfect (based on our notions), then
% the brain has no reason to be the best method of computation of
% information or close to it, hence we should not look at the model of the
% working of the brain,if it is just the approximation of the model of the
% ideal computation
% 
% Effect of spike as post synaptic potential is equivalent to a rectangular
% pulse, a neuron essentially looks at the sum of all the inputs and compares it
% to a value, if the value (voting) is higher than a threshold, then that
% signature of that information is conveyed to other neurons with different
% levels of same signature in terms of a weighted rectangular pulse and
% corresponding  input  information is then ignored (reset), but following
% incoming information is again checked (again)
% This basic unit shall be called a neuron
% This neurons forms network which have ability to do 'certain functions'
% depending on the 'weights' of the network
% 
% To do a specific work, specific structures of these networks could be
% 'trained' to do 'specific' tasks
% Graphs of these networks can be acyclic or cyclic, acyclic would need
% learning help from intrinsic parameters from rules called like 'STDP' and
% cyclic would need additional help from the neuron which completes the
% loop of a directional network
% 
% These networks can interact with the surrondings/environment once they are
% 'programmed' to be responsive to the stimuli they can perceive and could
% 'think' if their network evolves mainly temporally and also structurally
% (formation of new edges 'synapses' in graph) with representation of the
% 'events' as the 'activity' of the network
